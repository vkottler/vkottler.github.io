# Video Game Brainstorming

## Inspirations

Really just games (or game archetypes) that are fun (to me) because of how the
gameplay is designed, outside of the art or storyline.

* Warcraft / Starcraft / RTS
* DOTA-style games
* World of Warcraft / MMO
* 2D "arena combat" games
* Minecraft

## Desired Features

* 2D graphics likely top-down or "tilted" but favoring top-down feel, some
  "jumping" and y-axis elements should exist though
* "playing" involves creating a character where creating a character involves
  only cosmetic + name selection
* characters have stats that control potenty of abilities / attacks / heals
* characters have a fixed number of item slots of specific item types
* items have rarities, may have base stats, may have (up to a maximum number)
  slots for "gems" and "enhancements" where both can be added and removed from
  the item at any time
* all items can be traded / bought / sold (no "boundedness")
* characters can "level up", game has a level cap that never increases
* characters have access to all "talent trees" and affinities, where the latter
  is a form of "base ability selection" out of groups of options and the former
  is a way to spend "points" earned by leveling, affinities and talent points
  can be re-allocated arbitrarily outside of combat or instanced encounters
* players have a fixed number of inventory slots, but can get "bags" to
  increase these slots
* game should have "dungeons", small-group instanced encounters (pve)
* game should have "raids", large-group instanced encounters (pve)
* game should have instanced pvp, including objective-based battlegrounds
* "armor" items should have a certain weight/type, characters can select an
  affinity to a specific type of armor for some kind of bonus
* "weapon" items should have a certain weight/type, players should be able to
  choose an affinity to one or more weapon types
* overall "weight" of items equipped should affect mobility (slightly)
* fundamental types of "damage" should be physical, magical
* based on your affinities and talents, each player should show some kind of
  "at a glance" view that represents your build (i.e. "physical ranged",
  "hybrid melee dps + heal")
* categories of "role points" should be "melee physical", "ranged physical",
  "melee magical", "ranged magical", "area physical", "area magical",
  "melee heal", "ranged heal", "area heal", "melee control", "ranged control",
  "area control", "melee defense", "magical defense", "control resistance"
* notions of "missing" attacks or explicitly avoiding damage should be gameplay
  controlled, not RNG controlled

## Open Questions

* "looting" conops
* "loot drop" strategy and whether or not to incorporate RNG
* instance lockouts / limits?
* professions / open-world resource harvesting?
* role of in-game currency
* "grouped" vs. "solo" conops
* core storyline / lore / "pre-endgame" content?
* crit?
* character-progression-based rewards? cosmetics / titles? achievements /
  achievment points?
